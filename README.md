üß† Interview Questions & Answers ‚Äì Easha24x7 Healthcare Website
üéØ React & JavaScript
üîπ Beginner Level
Q: What is React and why did you choose it for this project?
A: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I chose it for its component reusability, virtual DOM performance, and ecosystem maturity, which are ideal for scalable healthcare applications.

Q: Explain the difference between functional and class components.
A: Functional components are simpler, support hooks for state and side effects, and are preferred in modern React. Class components use lifecycle methods and are becoming outdated.

Q: What are React Hooks and which ones did you use?
A: Hooks allow state and lifecycle features in functional components. I used:

useState ‚Äì for managing chatbot steps and user inputs

useEffect ‚Äì for chatbot auto-open logic

useRef ‚Äì for DOM manipulation and scroll behavior

üîπ Intermediate Level
Q: How did you implement the chatbot's multi-step flow?

js
Copy
Edit
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
const [userData, setUserData] = useState({});

if (currentStep < 4) {
  setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
  setUserData({ ...userData, [field]: inputValue });
}
Q: Explain your state management strategy in the chatbot.
A: I used separate useState hooks for chatbot open/close state, conversation steps, user data, and typing indicators, keeping state modular and clear.

Q: How did you handle side effects?

js
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  const autoOpenTimer = setTimeout(() => setIsOpen(true), 3000);
  return () => clearTimeout(autoOpenTimer);
}, []);
üîπ Advanced Level
Q: How would you optimize the app for performance?
A:

Use React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders

Implement lazy loading for components and images

Use useMemo for expensive computations

Optimize animations and limit reflows

Q: How would you implement error boundaries?
A: I‚Äôd create a class-based ErrorBoundary component using componentDidCatch() and getDerivedStateFromError() to catch JS errors, log them, and show a fallback UI.

üé® CSS & Tailwind CSS
Q: Why did you choose Tailwind CSS?
A: Tailwind's utility-first design speeds up development, ensures consistency, and keeps CSS scoped without writing custom stylesheets.

Q: How did you implement responsive design?

html
Copy
Edit
<div className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">...</div>
A: I followed a mobile-first approach and used Tailwind's breakpoint utilities.

Q: Explain your animation strategy.

css
Copy
Edit
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
A: I used CSS keyframes for entrance animations, floating elements, and pulse effects. Animations were optimized for performance.

Q: How did you ensure accessibility?
A: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, proper contrast ratios, alt text for images, and focus management.

üõ†Ô∏è Build Tools & Development
Q: Why Vite over CRA (Create React App)?
A: Vite provides lightning-fast dev server, faster HMR, smaller bundles, and native ES module support.

Q: Explain your folder structure.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css       # Global styles
Q: How would you deploy the application?
A: Run npm run build, deploy the output to Netlify/Vercel, configure env variables, and optionally integrate CI/CD pipelines.

    ...
  };
  await emailjs.send('SERVICE_ID', 'TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams);
};
Q: What are the security concerns with client-side email?
A: Use public keys, validate form data, implement CAPTCHA or rate limiting, and ideally move sensitive tasks server-side.

üè• Healthcare Domain Questions
Q: What compliance principles did you follow?
A: Basic HIPAA practices: input validation, user consent, secure transmission, and privacy-first UI design.

Q: How would you secure patient data?

End-to-end encryption

Secure authentication (OAuth or JWT)

Logging and access auditing

Role-based access control

Q: What features would you add for real-world healthcare use?
A:

Appointment scheduling system

Telemedicine integrations

Medical record dashboards

Patient portals with login

üß© Debugging & Problem Solving
Q: How did you debug TypeScript to JavaScript conversion?
A: I updated .tsx to .jsx, removed TypeScript annotations, fixed imports, and verified DOM behavior across components.

Q: Challenges faced with chatbot?
A: Managing sequential conversation flow, real-time validation, smooth transitions between questions, and email integration.

Q: How did you handle email sending errors?

js
Copy
Edit
try {
  await emailjs.send(serviceId, templateId, params);

Add testing (Jest, RTL, Cypress)

Modularize into micro-frontends

Q: What‚Äôs your testing strategy?

Unit tests ‚Äì for components

Integration tests ‚Äì for chatbot & email flows

E2E tests ‚Äì simulate user journeys

Accessibility tests ‚Äì via Lighthouse or Axe

A:

Use WebSockets or Socket.io

Create server for persistent chat state

Sync real-time messages with a queue or DB

üíº Project Management & Best Practices
Q: How did you maintain code quality?
A: ESLint config, consistent naming, clean folder structure, reusability, and inline comments.

Q: What version control strategy would you follow?
A:

Git Flow: main, dev, feature branches

Pull requests with reviews

Pre-commit hooks & automated tests

Q: How would you manage environments?
A: Use .env files for dev, staging, and prod. Configure builds with Vite's environment system.
